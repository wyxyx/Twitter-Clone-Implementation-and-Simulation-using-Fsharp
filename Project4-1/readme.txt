2. What is working

We have implemented an engine actor and many user actors in separate processes and use remote actors. 
We use one engine process and one user process to simulate the twitter.

We tested 4000 clients to run for 3 minutes, and the total amount of tweets is 430329.

3. Instructions to run the program

First run the program.fs of TwitterEngine and the program.fs of TwitterUser. Input the number of users in TwitterEngine.exe, and the program will run.
